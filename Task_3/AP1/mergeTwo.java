/*
 * Start with two arrays of strings, A and B, each with its elements in alphabetical order and without duplicates. Return a new array containing the first N elements from the two arrays. The result array should be in alphabetical order and without duplicates. A and B will both have a length which is N or more. The best "linear" solution makes a single pass over A and B, taking advantage of the fact that they are in alphabetical order, copying elements directly to the new array.


mergeTwo(["a", "c", "z"], ["b", "f", "z"], 3) → ["a", "b", "c"]
mergeTwo(["a", "c", "z"], ["c", "f", "z"], 3) → ["a", "c", "f"]
mergeTwo(["f", "g", "z"], ["c", "f", "g"], 3) → ["c", "f", "g"]
